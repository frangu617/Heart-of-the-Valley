## üó∫Ô∏è Reading Path By Goal

### "I just want to understand what changed"
1. SUMMARY.md
2. BEFORE_AFTER.md
3. Done! You have the overview.

### "I want to start migrating my code"
1. SUMMARY.md
2. README.md
3. IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
4. Start with one character using dawn.refactored.ts as template

### "I want to understand everything deeply"
1. SUMMARY.md
2. BEFORE_AFTER.md
3. REFACTORING_GUIDE.md
4. Review all code files
5. IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md

### "I'm in the middle of coding and need quick help"
1. QUICK_REFERENCE.md
2. Look at dawn.refactored.ts example
3. Check specific code files for details

## üí° Tips

1. **Don't try to read everything at once** - Start with SUMMARY.md and README.md
2. **Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md while coding** - It's designed for that
3. **Keep IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md open during migration** - Follow it step by step
4. **Refer to dawn.refactored.ts when stuck** - It's a complete working example
5. **Test as you go** - Don't migrate everything then test

## ‚ùì Need Help?

Can't find what you're looking for?

1. Check QUICK_REFERENCE.md first (fastest)
2. Search REFACTORING_GUIDE.md (most comprehensive)
3. Look at dawn.refactored.ts (working example)
4. Review relevant code file directly

## üìù Document Status
